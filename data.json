Dr. Barany’s new book, The New Welfare Consensus: Ideological, Political, and Social Origins (https://bit.ly/2xP4NhW), explores the origins of American antiwelfarism. He argues that it is rooted in conservative ideology but is now generally normalized across major sectors of US politics. The work and political engagement of antiwelfarist intellectuals and policy planning groups, along with the corresponding social conditions, facilitated the emergence of a new policy consensus that was more conservative, fiscally austere, demeaning, and coercive, culminating in the 1996 Welfare Reform Bill (PRWORA). A couple months after the 2016 general election, Professor Barany’s work addressed Donald Trump's political ascent by revisiting WWII-era research on authoritarianism and contemplating the economic and political landscapes of powerlessness and despair in American society. Professor Barany has taught at Pace University, The New York City College of Technology, John Jay College, and Dutchess Community College.",

She believes in teaching writing in project-based, interactive situations, where students can work toward a goal through brainstorming, drafting, revision, and learning to use feedback. Her aim each semester is to help students become more aware of their existing habits and beliefs as writers and readers, and to guide them to create and refine writing processes that can serve them in many different situations. Dominique regularly collaborates with colleagues across disciplines by teaching in themed learning communities and paired courses. She is also a member of LaGuardia's ePortfolio Leadership Team.\n\nDominique received her BA from Binghamton University in 2006, graduating summa cum laude with a major in English and a minor in studio art. She received her Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center in 2014, with concentrations in American Studies and Composition and Rhetoric. Her dissertation, \"Mind, Media and Techniques of Remediation, 1850-1910\", received the English Program's Alfred Kazin Award for the best dissertation in American Studies.\n\nShe has published on Emily Dickinson's poetry in the journal Textual Cultures, and on issues related to composition studies and community college writing programs in New Directions: Next Steps for/in Writing about Writing (Colorado UP 2019) and Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities (MLA Commons 2018). Dominique presents regularly at the College Conference on Composition and Communication. She is on the Editorial Collective of the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy and serves as a reviewer for the Journal of Basic Writing.",

I am currently completing a book-length project, The Spanish \"Dianas\": Their Significance, Impact, and Legacy (under contract with The Edwin Mellen Press) and working on a radical rereading of Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona.\nI have published numerous scholarly papers, reflecting my interest in renaissance rhetorical and allegorical poetics, in such journals as Renaissance Quarterly, Studies in Philology, The Journal of Comparative Literature, The Shakespeare Newsletter, The Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, Mediterranean Studies, and Portuguese Studies and have contributed a chapter, \"Exile under Fire: Reassessing the Poetics and Practice of Manuel de Faria e Sousa,\" to Global Impact of the Portuguese Language(Transaction Publishers, 2001). I have presented papers in such venues as, most recently, Miami, Florida: annual conference of the Renaissance Society of America; Florence, Italy, at the conference, \"Florence 2000\": Renaissance Society of America; Lisbon, Portugal (Biblioteca Nacional): Mediterranean Studies Association; Montreal and Albany: NEMLA; New York City: MLA; and Newark, N.J. (Rutgers University): first international conference on Portugal and Portuguese-speaking literature.\nI am fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, aspire to be an ever-better Latinist, and can read several other languages with relative ease. My primary avocations are “chilling” with my wife, children, close friends, and baby pooch, Macho; making home-made wine, a craft I learned in childhood from my father; and playing the classical guitar for which I also enjoy arranging jazz and international music. I am an active member of the Renaissance Society of America (for which I occasionally review scholarly books) and am listed in Who's Who Among America's Teachers (multiple-year honoree) and in the Directory of American Scholars. Among my special thrills in life are seeing my students' eyes light up as they make new, life-affirming discoveries about literature and feeling their energies energize mine as we share readings of magnificently enduring and probing texts.",

Her book, Managing Inequality: Northern Racial Liberalism in Interwar Detroit (New York University Press, 2014). illustrates that “colorblind racism” emerged in northern cities well before the large-scale demographic shifts of the Second World War. Miller demonstrates that white northern leaders increasingly embraced egalitarian ideas about racial difference at the same time that they helped implement and maintain social and political practices that promoted racial inequality. In other words, she shows that northern segregation and egalitarian language were intertwined.\n\nDr. Miller’s articles and reviews have appeared in the Journal of American History, the Middle West Review, The International Journal of Critical Pedagogy, The Michigan Quarterly Review, Michigan Feminist Studies, and Against the Current. She also published a book chapter in Groundwork: Local Black Freedom Struggles in America. Dr. Miller has been a faculty fellow at a number of centers at the CUNY Graduate Center, including the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics, the Center for Humanities, the Committee for the Study of Religion, and the Committee on Globalization and Social Change. She was also a visiting scholar at the Eisenberg Institute for Historical Studies at the University of Michigan. In 2015, she was awarded a Chancellor’s Research Fellowship from CUNY.\n\nDr. Miller’s current research focuses on the American colonial state in the Philippines and its effort to Christianize majority-Muslim islands in the south of the archipelago. That study will examine this program into the 1960s, when it was continued under the independent Philippine Republic.\n",

Information about HSAC can be found at http://www.laguardiahonors.com/. My scholarly work is concerned with the effects of (post)colonialism and globalization on the construction of identity (in particular, racialized ethnicity). With funding from a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC) Doctoral Fellowship, I completed a study on this subject, with a focus on the relationship between the writing of history and the emergence of subjectivity. I began a study of Asian North American avant-garde poetics and visual arts at New York University, where I held a SSHRCC Postdoctoral Fellowship. My research has been published in scholarly collections and journals as well as arts magazines, and has been presented at scholarly conferences in the US, Canada, Belgium and the UK.

Her approach to teaching ESL writing and grammar highlights the interaction between sentence grammar and the sound and intonation patterns of spoken English.\nThrough this lens students discover predictable patterns in both listening and grammar that increase their awareness of and enhance their linguistic knowledge. Ms. Gluck also teaches ELL 101, Introduction to Language, an introductory linguistics course for Liberal Arts and Education majors. She wrote the guidelines for the teaching of ELL 101 and maintains a Blackboard site of resources for instructors in this course.\nShe is a second level doctoral student in the Linguistics Program at the CUNY Graduate Center. Her research focuses on the Second Language Acquisition with a concentration in the role of phonology and prosody in the acquisition of a second language.

His doctoral dissertation, “The Bungled One: Failure and the Fictional Impetus,” inquires into the relationship between the intimate, solitary experience of being a person, and its expression in language. In exploring the Bible, and works by Marcel Proust, Herman Melville, and Georges Perec, the study puts forward the notion that it is the “failure,” to fully express who one is, that results in the consciousness proper to reading and writing fiction. Scheindlin is also at work on a study of democracy in the work of Herman Melville. His interests include phenomenology and hermeneutics; 20th Century French and American Poetry; and the theory of the novel. He has contributed to the volume The Proust Project, edited by André Aciman.",

After college, I spent two years in Europe, teaching English as a Second Language in Spain; this was when I discovered how enriching and satisfying teaching could be. I came to New York, began a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and, almost simultaneously, started teaching as an adjunct at Queens College. When I was hired full-time at LaGuardia in 1990, I became involved in learning communities (thematically clustered courses) and have since designed and taught in many with colleagues in Theatre and Philosophy. Last Fall, we taught a cluster called, Identity, Performance and Poetic Justice, and this Fall we are teaching Heroes, Gods and Monsters: Classic Stories Then and Now. More than anything else I appreciate the freedom LaGuardia has given me to design courses, expand programs and to work creatively with great students and colleagues. One course that I have found especially interesting to teach over the years is LIB 200, Humanism, Science and Technology, a capstone seminar for graduating liberal arts majors. In this seminar, students research and apply knowledge from core liberal arts courses to contemporary issues (from AIDS as a global pandemic to Sex Tourism in Thailand).",

His specialization is in Nineteenth Century African American and American Literature. He is revising his dissertation, Blacks Seeing Seeing Blacks: Surveillance and The Gaze in the Works of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and William Wells Brown for publication. This work explores the nexus between Foucault’s theory of surveillance and Lacan’s refinement of the theories of the Gaze. He is interested in the depiction of the visual forces of the “look,” “the gaze,” or surveillance, which reify the status of African Americans as diminished beings. Currently he is an Assistant Professor at LaGuardia Community College CUNY and working on a newer, though still related field, Hip-Hop Fiction or contemporary African American crime novels. He has recently presented two papers on the subject in New Mexico and The Bronx. “Hip-Hop Scribes: Uncomfortable Truths in Black on White” examined the creation of a new genre of African American or Black Literature outside of the confines of mainstream publishing. “Hip-Hop Scribes: Double-Consciousness Double-Crossed” examines how this new genre is, because of its unique genesis, able to transgress the DuBoisian paradigm of “self-consciousness” in African American Belle Lettres.",

It was also this wonderful teacher who gave me my first teaching gig at the tender age of 18, as a kind of junior T.A. I gave four lectures in a course called English for Engineers 100, and a passion for teaching was passed on. Here I am 25 quick years later and I still love what I do. Whether it's ENG 099 or ENG 250, it's always interesting, always challenging, and always fun. I have learned how profoundly great teaching impacts a person's life, and I experienced firsthand the ability to empower that a committed teacher possesses, so I try to remember that every time I enter a classroom.",
